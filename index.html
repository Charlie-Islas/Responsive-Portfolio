                Welcome to my personal portfolio. Thanks for taking the time to visit it and get to know a bit more about me. My name is Charlie Acevedo and I am 26 years old. After studying and working for five years in Germany, I am finally back in Mexico. I have always been a passionate reader and a "grammar nazi". My years abroad made me realize that a new language can give you as many (if not more) opportunities than a professional degree. This is why I decided to become a language teacher and make the most of my passion for linguistics, grammar, and all that has to do with languages. Up to now, I have only given private lessons and I have been lucky enough to have awesome, really smart pupils that take the lessons seriously and seize every chance to learn new stuff. I feel fortunate to have met every single one of my students and I believe that they will be very successful and happy people.

                The wonderful experiences abroad also made me realize that Mexico is an awesome country and that, despite the world being very small, mobility is hard and costly. Among other reasons, I think this was the main one that motivated me to become a web developer. I want to be able to work from whichever point in the globe I am. And I believe that web design is the future. The Internet is an ever-growing market that is supposed to help us connect with each other and break the borders that have divided us as a species for so many centuries. A lot has been made, but there is even much more to come. I believe I can take part in that process and contribute just a bit to make the world a better place for everyone.
